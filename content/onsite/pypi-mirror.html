### The mirror command

To create a pypi mirror run:

    binstar-sync-pypi --whitelist /etc/binstar/pypi-packages.txt

This will load all of the packages on pypi.python.org into the `~pypi` binstar user account.

To verify that this is working you may open your browser to http://<onsite.binstar.addr>/pypi/~pypi


{% endcall%}
{% call section('configure-pip') %}
### Configure pip

To configure pip to use this new mirror you must edit your `~/.pip/pip.conf` file:

    [global]
    index-url = http://<onsite.binstar.ipaddress>:<port>/pypi/~pypi/simple

{% endcall%}
{% call section('whitelist') %}
### Whitelist packages to be mirrored

If the argument `--whitelist <filename>` is
given, then the mirror will only sync packages that are contained
in the whitelist file.

The file must contain a newline seporated list of packages:

    # This is a comment
    Flask
    itsdangerous
    Jinja2
    Werkzeug
    twill

<div class="alert alert-info">
    PyPI is case sensitive. If you enter the package name wrong. the package will not exist.

</div>
