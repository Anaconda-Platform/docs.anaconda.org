### What is Binstar?
Binstar is a package management service which allows you to host software packages of all kinds.  Binstar is designed to make software development, release, and maintenance easy for you by providing broad package-management support. Binstar allows for both <strong>public</strong> and <strong>private</strong> package repositories, as well as package channels, providing a flexible and scalable service for groups and organizations of all sizes. Binstar is a [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io) product.

Binstar is an evolving service and we welcome your [feedback](mailto:support@binstar.org) and 
questions.

Hosting of freely available software will remain free for individuals and organizations hosting a limited number of packages.  We charge for the hosting of private packages and for very-large collections of freely available packages. For more information, please see our [plan options](https://binstar.org/about/plans/).
