Anaconda Cloud is the place to find and share Python packages, notebooks and environments. Anaconda Cloud works 
with the conda open source package and environment manager, which can be used on Windows, OS X or Linux.

To take advantage of Anaconda Cloud, youâ€™ll first want to:
- [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
- Get familiar with using conda. A good place to start is the [conda cheat sheet](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/cheatsheet.html)
and the [conda test drive](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html).

For developers, Anaconda Cloud is designed to make software development, release, and maintenance easy by providing 
broad package-management support. Anaconda Cloud allows for both free <strong>public</strong> and paid <strong>private</strong> 
package repositories, as well as package channels, providing a flexible and scalable service for groups and 
organizations of all sizes. Anaconda.org is a [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io) product.

Hosting of freely available software will remain free for individuals and organizations hosting up to twenty 
packages.  There is a small fee for the hosting of private packages or more than twenty 
packages. For more information, please see our [plan options](https://anaconda.org/about/pricing).

We welcome your [feedback and suggestions](mailto:support@anaconda.org).

If you want to [author packages](examples.html#CondaPackages) or
[access private packages](examples.html#UsingAnacondaOrgTokens) you will first need to
[create an account](https://anaconda.org/account/register) on
[anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org).

Now you will need to install the command line client:

    conda install anaconda-client

Once you have done that, make sure you can login:
