Anaconda Cloud makes it easy to find, access, store and share public and private notebooks, environments, and 
conda and PyPI packages, and to keep up with updates made to the packages and environments you’re using.

You can build packages using the Anaconda client CLI, then manually or automatically upload the packages 
to Anaconda Cloud to quickly share with others or access yourself from anywhere. 

To take advantage of Anaconda Cloud, you’ll first want to:

- [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

- Get familiar with using conda. A good place to start is the [conda cheat sheet](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/cheatsheet.html)
and the [conda test drive](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html).

For developers, Anaconda Cloud is designed to make software development, release, and maintenance easy by providing 
broad package management support. Anaconda Cloud allows for both free <strong>public</strong> and paid <strong>private</strong> 
package repositories, as well as package channels, providing a flexible and scalable service for groups and 
organizations of all sizes. Anaconda Cloud is a [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io) product.

Hosting of freely available software will always remain free for individuals and organizations hosting up to twenty 
public packages.  There is a small fee for the hosting of private packages or more than twenty 
packages. For more information, please see our [plan options](https://anaconda.org/about/pricing).
