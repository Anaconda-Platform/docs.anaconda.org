These two tools work together. The Anaconda CLI is used to connect to and manage your Anaconda Cloud account, upload packages you 
have created, generate access tokens to allow access to private packages. View the complete list of tasks after installing 
by running `anaconda -h`

Anaconda build is used only to build private or public packages that you can upload to Anaconda Cloud using Anaconda CLI. 

These tools can be installed any of three ways: from your conda environment, via PIP, or via PIP from source. We recommend 
using conda.

Install the anaconda client tools anaconda-client and anaconda-build at the same time from your [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/) 
environment:
{% example %}

    conda install anaconda-client anaconda-build

{% endsection %}

{% section %}

How to install anaconda-client and anaconda-build with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/)

{% example %}

    pip install anaconda-client anaconda-build

{% endsection %}

{% section %}

Or you can pip install both anaconda-client and anaconda-build from source:

{% example %}

    pip install git+https://github.com/Anaconda-Server/anaconda-client
    pip install git+https://github.com/Anaconda-Server/conda-server-build

{% endsection %}

{% section %}

If you are running anaconda-build workers on Linux, you must have the following prerequisite tools installed: 
tar, bzip2, ntp, chrpath, wget, dos2unix, gcc, gcc-c++, and git.

{% example %}

    yum install -y tar bzip2
    yum install -y ntp chrpath wget dos2unix gcc gcc-c++
    yum install -y git

{% endsection %}
