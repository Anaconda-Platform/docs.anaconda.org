## Using channels for test dev and production

Binstar channels allow you to upload files to your packages and control how they are accessed.

With binstar channels you can upload a file to a specific channel,
but only users listening to that channel will be able to install it.
This is particularly useful for moving a package through a development and testing flow.

In this example we will show you how to use a `test` channel,
So that you can upload files without affecting your production quality packages.
Without a `--channel` argument the default channel is `main`

{% endsection %}
{% section %}

Lets start with a conda package, if you don't have one, use our example conda package.
Before you build the package edit version the `meta.yaml` file in `binstar/example-packages/conda/` to be 2.0

{% example %}

    git clone https://github.com/Anaconda-Server/binstar
    cd binstar/example-packages/conda/
    vim meta.yaml # Bump Version
    conda config --set binstar_upload no
    conda build .

{% endsection %}
{% section %}

Now, upload your test package to binstar using the [binstar upload](cli.html#Upload) command.

You used the `--channel` option to tell the upload not to put it into your `main`
channel where all users will be able to install it.

{% example %}

    binstar upload #userdefined{/path/to/conda-package-2.0.tar.bz2} --channel #userdefined{test}

{% endsection %}

{% section %}

You will notice now that even when you search your conda `main` channel,
you won't see the `2.0` version of the test package. This is because you have to tell conda
to look in your new `test` channel.

The `--override` argument is telling conda not to use any channels in your `~/.condarc` file.

{% example %}

    #No 2.0 results
    conda search --override -c #userdefined{USERNAME} #userdefined{conda-package}

    #Your 2.0 package is here!
    conda search --override -c #userdefined{USERNAME}/channel/#userdefined{test} #userdefined{conda-package}

{% endsection %}

{% section %}

You can give the channel `#userdefined{USERNAME}/channel/test` to your testers.
Once they finish testing you may then want to copy the `test` packages back to your `main`
channel.

You can also manage your package channels on the web page: `https://anaconda.org/#userdefined{USERNAME}/#userdefined{conda-package}`
{% example %}

    binstar channel --copy #userdefined{test} main

	#Now version 2.0 is in your main channel
	conda search --override -c #userdefined{USERNAME} #userdefined{conda-package}

{% endsection %}
