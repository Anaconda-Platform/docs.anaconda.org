## Using channels for test dev and production

Binstar channels allow you to upload files to your packages and control how they are accessed.

With binstar channels you can upload a file to a specific channel,
but only users listening to that channel will be able to install it. 
This is particularly usefull for moving a package thru a development and testing flow.
You can upload a file to a `testing` channel, and when you or your team are satisfied that it 
is a release stable release, you can push it to `dev` and then to  `main` where all 
users will be able to install it.

Lets start with a conda package, if you don't have one, use our example conda package.

{% example %}

    git clone https://github.com/Binstar/binstar
    cd binstar/example-packages/conda/
    conda config --set binstar_upload no
    conda build .
