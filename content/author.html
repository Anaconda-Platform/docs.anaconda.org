Binstar is a package hosting service that allows uploading of a variety of package manager types. For concrete examples please see: 

 * [Authoring Conda Packages](conda.html#Author) 
 * [Authoring PyPI Packages](pypi.html#Author) 

## Creating a new Package

All packages you author must be created in a user account. To create a package go to [binstar.org/new](https://binstar.org/new) 

### Select the privacy access to your package:

You will be prompted with three options:

1. **Publish**: The new package will be published to the binstar `public` registries in much the same way as [pypi](https://pypi.python.org) is a single package registry.
   This is the simplest option, and however the package name *must* be unique among all of the other published packages. 
2. **Public**: The new package will be hosted on your personal registry, this package will be viewable and installable by anonymous users. 
   Users must add your unique registry url to their package manager's configuration.   
3. **Private**: The new package will be hosted on your personal registry, however you control the list of authorized users that will be able to access or modify this package.  


### Add a file to your package

To upload files to binstar it is recommended to use the [binstar command line client](https://github.com/binstar/binstar_client)
 
Run the command:
   
`binstar upload FILE-NAME`

#### Use Cases

 * [You want to author conda packages](conda.html#Author) 
 * [You want to author PyPI packages](pypi.html#Author)
