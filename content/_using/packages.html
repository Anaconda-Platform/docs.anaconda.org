#### Namespaces

{% endsection %}


{% section %}

Each user and organization has their own location called a **user namespace** where they may host packages.
You can view the public packages in a user or organization's namespace by navigating to their user page.

EXAMPLE: The [travis](https://anaconda.org/travis) user namespace located at https://anaconda.org/travis contains packages that were uploaded
and shared by the user whose account is named Travis. 

NOTE: All packages are public if uploaded by users of free accounts. Packages may be designated as private by upgrading 
to a paid account.

Anaconda Cloud supports two package managers: <em>([conda](using.html#CondaPackages) 
and [PyPI](using.html#PypiPackages))</em>. In order to interact with conda or PyPI packages, 
you must use their corresponding subdomains: 

 *  To install **conda** packages from the conda user, use the repository
     url [https://**conda**.anaconda.org/conda](https://conda.anaconda.org/conda)
 *  To install **pypi** packages from the conda user, use the repository
    url [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/conda](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda)

{% endsection %}


{% section %}

{{resource.add_subindex('Channels')}}
#### Channels

{% endsection %}
{% section %}

Furthermore each file within a package may be tagged in one or more channels.
This allows package authors to upload files for development or testing purposes without
affecting non-development users.

If you navigate to  [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/conda](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda) you will see a channel
dropdown listing all the available channels in this user namespace.

For example all of the pypi packages tagged as 'dev' can be shown here:

 *  [https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda/channel/dev](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda/channel/dev)

The default channel is the **main** channel.
If a file is tagged in the **main** channel then the channel name may be omitted from the URL.
For example the following repositories are equivalent:

 *  [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/conda/channel/main](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda/channel/main)
 *  [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/conda](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda)

{% endsection %}

{% section %}

{{resource.add_subindex('Private packages')}}
#### Private packages

{% endsection %}
{% section %}

Packages may also be private. This means that a user must explicitly have access to view the package.
To view and install private packages, you must identify yourself to anaconda.org.
This is done with [access tokens](using.html#Tokens).
Once you have generated a token (`<TOKEN>`), you may prefix any repository url with `/t/<TOKEN>`

Note: this is just an example. You will not see any extra private packages in the conda **user namespace**.

 *  To install **private conda** packages from the conda user, use the repository
     url [https://**conda**.anaconda.org/t/&lt;TOKEN&gt;/conda](https://conda.anaconda.org/conda)
 *  To install **private pypi** packages from the conda user, use the repository
    url [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/t/&lt;TOKEN&gt;/conda](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda)

#### Package privacy settings

{% endsection %}
{% section %}

You will be prompted with two options:

1. **Personal**: The new package will be hosted on your personal repository. This package will be viewable and installable by anonymous users.
   Users must add your unique repository url to their package manager's configuration.
1. **Private**: The new package will be hosted on your personal repository; however, you control the list of authorized users that will be able to access or modify this package.
