### Why Tokens?

Tokens can be used to make specific private repositories, collections or packages available to other users.  Additionally, the degree of access a token grants is completely configurable at the time of generation.


### How To Generate a Token

At present, tokens can only be generated using the binstar client.  You can find more information on installing and configuring the binstar client [here](/build_cli.html).

Once you have successfully installed the binstar client, you can generate a token via the following command:

<pre class="short">
  <code>
  binstar auth --create --name MyTokenNameHere --scopes 'repos conda:download'
  </code>
</pre>

This will generate a random, alphanumeric token string, which you can then distribute to fellow binstar users.  

This sample token provides access to download any of your private conda repositories.   To use the token, simply issue the following command:

<pre class="short">
  <code>
  conda config --add channels https://conda.binstar.org/t/<strong>TokenValue</strong>/
  </code>
</pre>

### Reviewing Tokens

You can review all tokens generated with your binstar account from the command line:
<pre class="short">
  <code>
    binstar auth --list
  </code>
</pre>

Or in your [user settings](https://binstar.org/settings/access) on [http://binstar.org](http://binstar.org).  

Please note: although you can review tokens from the binstar client, for security reasons you can only view the actual token value from your binstar.org account.  

### Revoking Tokens

You can revoke a token at any time from your [user settings](https://binstar.org/settings/access).


### Additional Configuration Options
<dl class="switches">
  <dt>-o</dt>
  <dd>Set the token owner (must be an organization).  <strong>Note:</strong>You must have administrative rights to an organization in order to use this option.</dd>
  <dt>-s</dt>
  <dd>Scopes for token. For example if you want to limit this token to conda downloads only you would use --scopes "repo conda:download".  For a full list of scoping options, use "binstar auth --list-scopes"</dd>
  <dt>-w</dt>
  <dd>Create a shorter token.  <strong>Note:</strong> Default behavior is a longform (stronger) token.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>

Use the binstar auth -h option for additional configuration information.
