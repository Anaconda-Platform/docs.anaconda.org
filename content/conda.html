## Installing Conda packages

The basic way to install a package from binstar is using conda:

```
conda install --channel https://conda.binstar.org/:username PACKAGE
```

Where **REGISTRY-PATH** may be one of the following:


1. A **username**, this allows installation of packages from a user registry:
   ```
   conda install --channel https://conda.binstar.org/:username PACKAGE
   ```

1.  A **user channel**, this allows installation of packages from a collection of packages a user has put together:
    ```
    conda install --channel https://conda.binstar.org/collections/:username/channel/:channel-name PACKAGE
    ```

    The **main** channel is the default channel:
    `https://conda.binstar.org/USER/channel/main` is equivalent to `https://conda.binstar.org/USER`


## Installing Private Packages

All urls can be prefixed with `/t/$TOKEN` to access private packages.

```
TOKEN=$(binstar auth --create --name YOUR-TOKEN-NAME)
```
```
conda install --channel https://conda.binstar.org/t/$TOKEN/USER PACKAGE
```
