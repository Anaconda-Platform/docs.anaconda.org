{% call section('Build Workers', self) %}

This section contains advanced information on configuring builds on the [anaconda.org](http://anaconda.org)
platform. If you are not already familiar with the build process, please begin by reading this guide on
[how to submit your first build](/examples.html#SubmitYourFirstBuild).

Please note that anaconda build defaults to the linux-64 platform, and that [anaconda.org](http://anaconda.org)provides free linux-64 workers.  If you do **not** need to build for other platforms, you can complete package builds using only [anaconda.org](http://anaconda.org). Further, all anaconda.org accounts allow you to
attach one free worker. If you need more workers or workers on other platforms, you will need to [create a binstar organization](/#CreatingAnOrganization) and [upgrade to a paid plan](/#PaidPlans).

Binstar build workers allow you to run your builds
on your own machines. A build worker can run on any
machine that supports bash (posix) or batch (win32).

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to
 [install the build cli](/examples.html#InstallingTheBinstarCommand).


{% call subsection('Create a Build Queue') %}

The first thing you will need to do is create a build queue.
Build queues are used to as a container to direct builds you have submitted
to the build workers you will create. At present, when you submit a job the default build queue is `binstar/public`.

To create your queue run:

{% syntax bash %}
	anaconda build queue --create USERNAME/QUEUENAME
{% endsyntax %}

Where `USERNAME` is your [anaconda.org](http://anaconda.org)
username and `QUEUENAME` is an alphanumeric name of your choice.  For more information about configuring your build queues, please go [here](#/ConfiguringBuildQueues).

{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Launching a Build Worker') %}

Before you can begin using the queue you created, you will need to attach a build-worker to the queue.   The basic build worker runs on your machine (Linux, OS-X or Windows) as the current user
(see [security considerations](#SecurityConsiderations)) and accepts jobs from the build queue that you specify.

In order to avoid the build-worker waiting on user input for conda commands, conda must be configured not to prompt for confirmation. Run the following command to set the configuration correctly:

{% syntax bash %}
        conda config --set always_yes true
{% endsyntax %}

A worker needs to be registered before it can be run.  This command registers a worker for the queue USERNAME/QUEUE and outputs the worker's id and other arguments to a yaml file in ~/.workers/ with the worker's id as the yaml filename.

{% syntax bash %}
    anaconda worker register USERNAME/QUEUE
{% endsyntax %}

To see other options for registering workers, try
{% syntax bash %}
    anaconda worker register --help
{% endsyntax %}

The register step should print out a worker id you can use to run a worker.  This command will start a worker with a ```worker_id```:

{% syntax bash %}
	anaconda worker run <worker-id-from-register-step>
{% endsyntax %}

That's it!  You can now submit a job to your queue and your new build worker will pick it up and build it:

{% syntax bash %}
    anaconda build submit ./my-build --queue USERNAME/QUEUENAME
{% endsyntax %}

**Please note** that you must leave your build worker process running in order to submit builds to it.  You may wish to attach build workers to your queue using a nohup command or similar.

Finally, after killing the anaconda build worker process, it is required to deregister the worker, unless you plan to start the worker again with the same worker id and configuration.  The deregister step can be done with:

{% syntax bash %}
    anaconda worker deregister <worker-id-from-register-step>
{% endsyntax %}

If you need to deregister a worker, but have lost the yaml file output from the register step, then check your Anaconda server instance's /settings/build-queue page to remove the worker or list the workers you have registered with this command:

{% syntax bash %}
    anaconda worker list
{% endsyntax %}

Review all help for register, run, deregister, and list with:
{% syntax bash %}
    anaconda worker -h
{% endsyntax %}

{% endcall %}


{% call subsection('Configuring Build Queues') %}
By default your build worker will run builds on your `binstar/public` queue; you may change this one of two ways:

 1. Use the `--queue` option when issuing a `anaconda build` [submit, save or trigger](cli.html#SubmittingBuilds) command, e.g.
    {% syntax bash %}
    anaconda build save ./my-build --queue USERNAME/QUEUENAME
    {% endsyntax %}
 1. Specify a default queue for your build workers.
    This will affect all builds for your account.
    You can do this by visiting [anaconda.org/settings/build-queue](https://anaconda.org/settings/build-queue)
    and clicking the **Set as Default** option for whichever queue you would like to use.

{% call subsubsection('Share your build queue') %}

Once a build queue is created, you can control who may submit jobs to it. For build queues associated with an organization rather than an individual user, the default behavior is that only organization owners may submit jobs to the queue.

To share access to your queue:

 1. Navigate your browser to [anaconda.org/settings/build-queue](https://anaconda.org/settings/build-queue)
 	1. If you are an owner in multiple organizations, be sure to select the correct one in the drop-down in the upper right corner of the page.
 1. Click on the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></i> icon of the queue you want to share.
 1. Add the user by name (individual accounts) or by group (organization accounts).

{% endcall %}

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Security Considerations') %}

Because build workers run on your machine, using the current user account, there are a few security considerations associated with launching a build worker.  Remember the build worker runs user-defined build scripts from the jobs that are submitted to it.

We recommend you:

 1. Consider who you are giving access to your build queue.
 1. The `anaconda build worker` builds are permanent, make sure users can not accidentally
    change the state of your build machine.

{% call subsection('Executing Builds in a Docker Container') %}

The anaconda build cli includes the ability to build in a docker container::

{% syntax bash %}
	docker pull binstar/linux-64
    anaconda worker register USERNAME/QUEUENAME
    # prints worker-id
	anaconda worker docker_run <worker-id> --image binstar/linux-64
{% endsyntax %}

{% endcall %}

{% endcall %}

{% endcall %}
