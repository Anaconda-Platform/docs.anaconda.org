if you have not done so please read through
[how to submit your first build](/examples.html#SubmitYourFirstBuild) 
binstar.org also comes with free linux-64 workers so if you only need to 
use those then you are already set.

Binstar build workers allow you to run your builds on your own machines. 
A build worker can run on any machine that supports bash (posix) or batch (win32).
 
All binstar.org accounts allow you to attach one free worker. 
If you need more workers you will need to [create a binstar
organization](/#CreatingAnOrganization) and [Upgrade to a paid plan](/#PaidPlans).


To follow along, you will need to 
[install the build cli](/examples.html#InstallingTheBinstarCommand) 


{%   call subsection('Create a build queue') %}

The first thing you will need to do is create a build queue. 
Build queues are used to as a container to direct builds you have submitted
to the build workers you will create. Presently, when you submit a job the default build queue is
named `binstar/public`.

To create your queue run:
{%   syntax bash %}
binstar-build queue --create USERNAME/QUEUENAME
{%   endsyntax %}

You should replace `USERNAME` with your username and `QUEUENAME` with an alphanumeric name of your choice.

By default a build worker will run builds submitted to your `binstar/public` you may change this one of two ways.

 1. Use the `--queue` option for the `binstar-build` [submit, save or trigger](cli.html#SubmittingBuilds) commands  
    eg.
    {% syntax bash %}
    binstar-build submit ./my-build --queue USERNAME/QUEUENAME
    {% endsyntax %}
 1. Set your default queue. 
    This will affect all builds for your account. 
    Navigate your browser to [binstar.org/settings/build-queue](https://binstar.org/settings/build-queue)
    and select **Set as Default** 
 
{%   endcall %}

{%   call subsection('Launching a Build Worker') %}

The basic build worker runs on your machine (linux, osx or windows) as the current user 
(see [security considerations](#SecurityConsiderations)) 
and accepts jobs from the build queue that you specify. 

{% syntax bash %}
binstar-build worker USERNAME/QUEUENAME
{% endsyntax %}

Thats it!  When you submit a job to your queue, your new build worker will pick it up and build it. 

{%   endcall %}

{%   call subsection('Share your build queue') %}

Any build queues you create allow you to control who may submit jobs to it. 
By default only the organization owners will be able to submit jobs.

To share access to your queue:

 1. Navigate your browser to [binstar.org/settings/build-queue](https://binstar.org/settings/build-queue)
 1. Select the owner of the queue in the owner drop-down in the top right corner of the settings page.
 1. Click on the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></i> icon of the queue you want to share.
 1. Add the user by name or (individual accounts) or by group (organization accounts).


{%   endcall %}



{%   call subsection('Security Considerations') %}

There are a few security considerations when launching a build worker.
Remember the build worker runs user defined build scripts from the jobs that are submitted to it.

You must:

 1. Consider who you are sharing your build queue with.
 1. The `binstar-build worker` builds are permanent, make sure users can not accidentally 
    Change the state of your build machine.

{%       call subsubsection('Build-Worker Tokens') %}

The first thing that you will want to do is remove your full login credentials from the worker.
Otherwise build scripts would have the power to manage your binstar account to do this you need to create a token.


{% syntax bash %}
# Create a token with a limited scope and put it into the file ~/.binstar.token
binstar auth --create -n "My Build Token" --scopes "build:worker" --out ~/.binstar.token

# Log out of your binstar account so build scripts can not use your credentials
binstar logout

# Launch the worker again with the new token as your credentials 
binstar-build -t ~/.binstar.token worker USERNAME/QUEUENAME

{% endsyntax %}

The same token value can be used for all of the workers in the queue.

{%       endcall %}

{%       call subsubsection('Create a binstar user account') %}

Another security consideration you will want to consider is to 
create a new user account on your machine.
Remember to remove all passwords or user accounts then run your `binstar-build -t ~/.binstar.token worker`
from your new user account.

{%     syntax bash %}
