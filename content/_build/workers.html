Binstar build workers allow you to run your builds on your own machines. 
A build worker can run on any machine that supports bash (posix) or batch (win32). 

You will need to 
[install the build cli](/examples.html#InstallingTheBinstarCommand) 
to run this example.
{%   call subsection('Create a build queue') %}

The first thing you will need to do is create a build queue. 
Build queues are used to as a container to direct builds you have submitted
to the build workers you will create. Presently, when you submit a job the default build queue is
named `binstar/public`.

To create your queue run:
{%   syntax bash %}
binstar-build queue --create USERNAME/QUEUENAME
{%   endsyntax %}

You should replace `USERNAME` with your username and `QUEUENAME` with an alphanumeric name of your choice.
 
{%   endcall %}

{%   call subsection('Launching a build worker') %}

By default a build worker will run builds submitted to your  

{% syntax bash %}
binstar-build worker USERNAME/QUEUENAME
{% endsyntax %}

{%   endcall %}


{% endcall %}
