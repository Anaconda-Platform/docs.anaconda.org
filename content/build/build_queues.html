# Purpose

Binstar provides a default public queue that is mannaged by continuum analytics. 

The the purpose of the binstar build queue is to allow any user to add a build worker for their 
organization or user account. User build queues are private and the owner can controll who may build 
on their queue.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
 <strong>Note:</strong> you should already be comfortable submitting jobs to binstar 
 build before creating a new build queue 
</div>

{% call section('adding-a-queue') %}
# Add a build queue to your account

In your browser navigate to 
[https://alpha.binstar.org/settings/build-queue](https://alpha.binstar.org/settings/build-queue) 
And select "New Queue"

<center>
<img src="../media/img/add-a-queue.png" alt="Org Dashboard Dropdown" style="width: 75%;" align="middle"/>
</center>

Once there, you will be prompted to fill out the following form:

<center>
<img src="../media/img/new-queue.png" alt="Org Dashboard Dropdown" style="width: 75%;" align="middle"/>
</center>

 *  **Name**: must be a unique name, your queue name will always be prefixed with `build-<your-username>-`
 *  **Platforms**: must be a comma seporated list of platforms you plan on running build workers from.
    The currenlty supported platforms are `osx-64`, `linux-64` and `linux-32`
 * **Default**: The if selected, all build jobs submitted to your account will go to this queue 
   unless otherwise specified
 

## Modify the build queue

Navigate to your build queue to edit the properties from there you may:

 *  Modify the list of platforms your queue supports
 *  Give other users access to build on your queue
 
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> If you do this, these users may run arbitrary scripts on make sure that
    they are trusted 
    </div>
 *  Set the queue as default
 *  View the list of running workers

# Add a build worker to process jobs on your queue 

First you must install binstar-build version 0.6.0 or greater

    conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/binstar binstar-build
    
You only need to do this step once, 
if you have already done this on another machine point your browser to
your [settings/access](https://binstar.org/settings/access) page and copy your **binstar-workers** token
to the `~/binstar.token` file on the build-machine:

    binstar auth --create --name build-workers --scopes api:build-worker > ~/binstar.token

Once this is complete run the worker, this will start a worker process that runs forever. 
    
    binstar-build -t $(<~/binstar.token) worker <QUEUE-NAME>
    
You may want to run this process under a service like [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) 
to ensure that it runs forever 

{% endcall %}
{% call section('test-your-queue') %}
# Test your build queue

From any machine (prefrebly not on your build worker machine) submit a binstar build with the 
`--queue` option.

    binstar-build submit <path-to-your-test-job> --queue <QUEUE-NAME> 

{% endcall %}
