<a id="Installing On-site Binstar"></a>

Much as Anaconda Server allows you to maintain a private Anaconda repository, Onsite Binstar installation allows you to create and maintain a private version of [anaconda.org](http://anaconda.org) for easy creation and sharing of custom conda and PyPI packages within your organization.

The following instructions will guide you through the process of installing and configuring your Onsite Binstar installation.  If you have any questions about this process, please contact your sales representative for additional assistance.


{% call section('requirements')%}
### Requirements

* root access
* network connectivity
* an Onsite Binstar installation token (this will be provided to you by your sales representative at the time of purchase).


This installation guide is grouped into three components: steps that must be performed with root access, steps that should be performed as the binstar user, and maintenance and configurable aspects of the installation which you may wish to customize.

{% endcall %}

Perform as Root
---------------

### Install MongoDB

See the `official installation guide [http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) for installation instructions for your platform.  Once you have successfully installed and started MongoDB, you can proceed with your installation.

Because the MongoDB instance must be running before the Binstar server can be started, you will likely want to configure MongoDB to run automatically on machine startup::

	sudo chkconfig mongod on

### Update IPTables

In order to make your Onsite Binstar installation available to your users, you will need to configure your IPTables.  If you wish to run Onsite Binstar on a non-standard port, you may need to alter this configuration accordingly::

	sudo iptables -t nat -F

	# HTTP
	iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT

	# HTTPS
	iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

	# Save IPTables
	sudo service iptables save

	# Restart IPTables
	sudo service iptables restart

Log the output to Continuum
***************************

Please note: This step is optional, but highly recommended.

The following command will log activity from your server to our Loggly records so we can better support your Onsite Binstar installation.

First, confirm the machine has access to Loggly::

	# Should return a succcess
	ping -c 5 -W 5 logs-01.loggly.com

	# Should print '1'
	curl --connect-timeout 10 logs-01.loggly.com:514 2>&1 | grep "Empty reply from server" | wc -l


Add the file /etc/rsyslog.d/22-loggly.conf with the following content::

	$ cat > /etc/rsyslog.d/22-loggly.conf <<'EOF'
	# Define the template used for sending logs to Loggly. Do not change this format.
	$template LogglyFormat,"<%pri%>%protocol-version% %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %app-name% %procid% %msgid% [b6c51421-e072-4843-8436-215ec2ffcf9e@41058] %msg%"

	# Send messages to Loggly over TCP using the template.
	*.*             @@logs-01.loggly.com:514;LogglyFormat
	EOF

Now restart your rsyslog process::

	sudo service rsyslog restart


Create the Binstar user
***********************

It is recommended although not required that you create a binstar user at this time::

	sudo useradd binstar
	sudo mkdir -m 0770 /etc/binstar
	sudo chown binstar:binstar /etc/binstar

At this point, you can transition to the binstar user account, as you will not need root access for any of the remaining steps::

	sudo su - binstar


Perform as Binstar User
-----------------------

Install Miniconda
*****************

Download and install Miniconda, which will give you access to the conda command::

	curl 'http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-3.5.5-Linux-x86_64.sh' > Miniconda.sh
	bash Miniconda.sh

By default, Miniconda will install in the directory from which you execute the installer; you have the option to override this configuration and choose a different directory if you wish.  Upon successfully completing the installation, you will be prompted to add the install location to your path::

	Do you wish the installer to prepend the Miniconda install location
	to PATH in your /home/binstar/.bashrc ? [yes|no]
	[no] >>> yes

You must answer "yes" to ensure Miniconda will be added to your path variable.  You will also need to open a new terminal session or refresh your ~/.bashrc file for this change to take effect.

Install Binstar
***************

In order to install Onsite Binstar, you will need to execute the cas-installer tool using the custom Onsite Binstar token provided to you by your sales representative at the time of purchase::

	conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/t/<TOKEN>/binstar
	conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/t/TOKEN/binstar binstar-server


Configure the Binstar server
****************************


Initialize the Binstar server instance, and indicate the desired filepath for package storage::

	binstar-config --init
	binstar-config --set fs_storage_root /etc/binstar/package-storage

.. Note: : You may change the /package-storage directory to any location that is accessible by the binstar user.


Create your initial Onsite Binstar superuser::

	binstar-create-user --username "<username>" --password "<password>" --superuser

Run the Onsite Binstar server installation::

	binstar-server --port 8080

You should now see a working, private installation of anaconda.org when you visit <IP>:8080.

Finally, you may wish to automatically restart your Onsite Binstar installation if the instance fails or errors.

Create a supervisord instance::

	mkdir -p $HOME/miniconda/etc/
	echo_supervisord_conf > $HOME/miniconda/etc/supervisord.conf

Add the following lines to the supervisord.conf file you just created::

	[program:binstar-server]
	command=binstar-server
	stdout_logfile=syslog
	stderr_logfile=syslog

	[program:binstar-worker]
	command=mtq-worker -c binstar.tasks.worker high default low
	stdout_logfile=syslog
	stderr_logfile=syslog

You can now start and restart the Binstar server with the following commands::

	#starts binstar server
	supervisord
	#restarts binstar server
	supervisorctl restart all


Maintenance and Configuration Concerns
--------------------------------------

Run Onsite Binstar on an Alternate Port
***************************************

You  may wish to run your server on a port other than 8080.  To do so, you will need to adjust the above instructions for the following items:

- adjust port numbers in iptables configuration
- specify port in supervisord.conf file


Start Onsite Binstar When the Machine Boots
*******************************************
If you wish to automatically start the Binstar instance whenever the machine is rebooted, you can do this by configuring your init.d file to run the supervisord command.

Recommended General Maintenance
*******************************

- regular updates of the binstar-server package via conda
- configuring database backups
- configuring file system backups
- reviewing error logs
