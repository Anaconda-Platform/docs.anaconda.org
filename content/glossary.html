{% call subsection('Anaconda')%}
An easy-to-install, free collection of Open Source packages, including Python and 
the conda package manager, with free community support. Over 150 packages are 
installed with Anaconda. The Anaconda repository contains over 250 additional Open 
Source packages that can be installed or updated after installing Anaconda with 
the ``conda install PACKAGENAME`` command.
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Anaconda Cloud')%}
Anaconda Cloud hosts hundreds of useful Python packages, notebooks and environments 
for a wide variety of applications. You don't need to have an Anaconda Cloud account, 
or to be logged in, to search for public packages, download and install them. Anaconda 
Cloud works with the Anaconda-Build command line interface to build packages on your 
local computer. Anaconda Cloud is located at anaconda.org.  
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Anaconda-Build CLI')%}
The command line interface (CLI) to Anaconda.org that lets you build cross-platform packages 
with build workers on a cloud computing service or on your local computer. Contrast 
to conda-build which can build packages only for your local operating system.
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Anaconda-Client CLI')%}
The Anaconda-Client command line interface (CLI) allows you to log into Anaconda.org 
directly from your terminal window and manage your account. Anaconda-Client must 
be installed before you can build cross-platform packages with Anaconda-Build. It 
is not necessary for downloading or installing packages from Anaconda.org.
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Binstar')%}
Binstar was an early project name for Anaconda Cloud. You may still see the term 
Binstar in certain command and directory names. 
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Build Queue')%}
A build queue is the location where new package building and testing requests (also called "build jobs" or "builds") are sent when a user or organization requests a build to be created. This can be done automatically with continuous integration (CI) with sites such as Github or manually through the user interface.

- A user (organization or individual) submits jobs to a queue with the CLI.
- A queue may have multiple workers attached to it.
- Most queues are private. Anaconda Cloud also offers a public queue for building Linux-64 packages, which can be used by any Anaconda Cloud user.
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Build Worker')%}
A build worker is a machine running the Anaconda Build client, typically an Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance.

When a build worker is first created, it must be registered with an Anaconda Build queue in order for the queue to know about it and delegate incoming requests of the right type to that build worker.

- Each worker runs on only one platform, so it can only receive and execute build jobs that should be executed on that platform. For example, to build a job for Win-32 you must create a Win-32 worker.
- More than one worker may be attached to a queue to reduce wait time in the queue. There may be more than one worker for one operating system. For example, a queue could have two Linux-32 workers and one Win-64 worker. 
- The worker will do the actual work of building, compiling and testing the package and may optionally then upload the compiled package to Anaconda Cloud. 
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Channels')%}
The URLs on Anaconda.org where conda looks for packages. Using the Anaconda-Client 
CLI, package developers can create additional channels such as development (channel/dev) 
or test (channel/test) which will be searched only if the user specifies the channel.  

https://anaconda.org/travis - the default channel  
https://anaconda.org/travis/channel/main - same as the default channel  
https://anaconda.org/travis/channel/dev - contains the packages in development  
https://anaconda.org/travis/channel/test - contains packages ready to test.  
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Conda')%}
The conda package manager and environment manager program that installs and updates 
packages and their dependencies, and lets you easily switch between environments 
on your local computer.  
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Conda-Build')%}
The command line interface that lets you build packages for your local operating 
system. Contrast to Anaconda.org that lets you build cross-platform packages.
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Conda package')%}
A tarball (compressed file) containing system-level libraries, Python modules, 
executable programs, or other components. 
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Miniconda')%}
A minimal installer for conda. Like Anaconda, Miniconda is a software package that 
includes the conda package manager and Python and its dependencies, but does not 
include any other packages. Once conda is installed by installing either Anaconda 
or Miniconda, other software packages may be installed directly from the command 
line with 'conda install'. See also Anaconda and conda.
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Noarch package')%}
A conda package that contains nothing specific to any system architecture, so it 
may be installed on any system. When conda does a search for packages on any system 
in a channel, conda always checks both the system-specific subdirectory, for 
example, ``linux-64`` *and* the ``noarch`` directory. 
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('OnSite')%}
Anaconda Cloud is powered by Anaconda Server by Continuum Analytics. Run your own 
Anaconda server behind firewalls or in air-gapped environments. Contact [sales@continuum.io](mailto:sales@continuum.io) 
for more information.
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Organization')%}
An organization account is a type of account on Anaconda.org that allows multiple 
individual users to administer packages and control package access to different 
user groups. It also includes a large amount of storage space. 
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Repository')%}
A storage location from which software packages may be retrieved and installed on 
a computer.  
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Source package')%}
"Source" packages are source code only, not yet built for any specific platform, 
and might be compatible with all, some, or only one of the platforms. 
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('Token')%}
A token (or authentication token) is the mechanism by which anonymous users can 
download private packages without using an Anaconda Cloud account. It is an alpha-numeric 
code that is inserted into a URL that allows access by anyone who has the URL. You 
can use anaconda-client to generate new tokens to give other users specifically 
scoped access to packages and collections.
{% endcall %}

{% call subsection('User Namespace')%}
The part of Anaconda Cloud where a user or organization may host packages. For 
example, the *user namespace* https://anaconda.org/travis contains packages that 
were uploaded and shared by the user named Travis.
