{% from "macros.html" import section, subsection with context  %}

{%- call section('Packages', self) -%}
{% call subsection('Namespaces') %}

Packages on binstar are contained within namespaces.
Each user has his or her own personal namespace called a **user namespace** where they may host packages.
You can view the packages in a user's namespace by navigating to their user page.
For example, the [binstar](https://binstar.org/binstar) user namespace contains the binstar users packages.


Please note that supported package managers <em>([conda](conda.html) and [pypi](pypi.html)</em> have 
corresponding subdomains which must be observed in order to interact with the packages:

 *  To install **conda** packages from the binstar user, use the repository
     url [https://**conda**.binstar.org/binstar](https://conda.binstar.org/binstar)
 *  To install **pypi** packages from the binstar user, use the repository
    url [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/binstar](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar)

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Channels') %}

Furthermore each file within a package may be tagged in zero or more [channels](channels.html),
this allows package authors to upload files for development or testing purposes without
affecting non-development users.

If you navigate to  [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/binstar](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar) you will see a channel
dropdown listing all the available channels in this user namespace.

For example all of the pypi packages tagged as 'dev' can be shown here:

 *  [https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar/channel/dev](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar/channel/dev)

The default channel is the **main** channel.
If a file is tagged in the **main** channel then the channel name may be omitted from the url

For example the following repositories are equivalent:

 *  [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/binstar/channel/main](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar/channel/main)
 *  [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/binstar](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar)

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Private Packages') %}

Packages may also be private. This means that you must explicitly have access to view the package.
To view and install private packages, you must identify yourself to binstar.
This is done with [access tokens](token_gen.html)
Once you have generated a token (`<TOKEN>`), you may prefix any repository url with `/t/<TOKEN>`

Note this is just an example, you will not see any extra private packages in the binstar **user namespace**

 *  To install **private conda** packages from the binstar user, use the repository
     url [https://**conda**.binstar.org/t/&lt;TOKEN&gt;/binstar](https://conda.binstar.org/binstar)
 *  To install **private pypi** packages from the binstar user, use the repository
    url [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/t/&lt;TOKEN&gt;/binstar](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar)

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Creating a new Package') %}


All packages you author must be created in a user account. To create a package go to [binstar.org/new](https://binstar.org/new)

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Select the privacy access to your package') %}

You will be prompted with two options:

1. **Personal**: The new package will be hosted on your personal repository, this package will be viewable and installable by anonymous users.
   Users must add your unique repository url to their package manager's configuration.
1. **Private**: The new package will be hosted on your personal repository, however you control the list of authorized users that will be able to access or modify this package.


{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Add a file to your package') %}

To upload files to binstar it is recommended to use the [binstar command line client](cli.html#Binstar)

Run the command:

`binstar upload FILE-NAME`


Your package can now be found on your profile page `https://binstar.org/<USERNAME>/<PACKAGE>`

{% call subsection('Use Cases') %}

 * [You want to install conda packages](examples.html#CondaPackages)
 * [You want to install PyPI packages](examples.html#PypiPackages)
