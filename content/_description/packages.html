{% call subsection('Namespaces') %}

Packages on [anaconda.org](http://anaconda.org) are contained within namespaces.
Each user and organization has their own namespace, called a **user namespace**  where they may host packages.

You can view the packages in a user or organization's namespace by navigating to their user page.
For example, the [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda) user namespace contains the conda user's packages.


Please note that supported package managers <em>([conda](examples.html#CondaPackages) 
and [pypi](examples.html#PypiPackages))</em> have
corresponding subdomains which must be observed in order to interact with the packages:

 *  To install **conda** packages from the conda user, use the repository
     url [https://**conda**.anaconda.org/conda](https://conda.anaconda.org/conda)
 *  To install **pypi** packages from the conda user, use the repository
    url [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/conda](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda)

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Channels') %}

Furthermore each file within a package may be tagged in zero or more channels.
This allows package authors to upload files for development or testing purposes without
affecting non-development users.

If you navigate to  [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/conda](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda) you will see a channel
dropdown listing all the available channels in this user namespace.

For example all of the pypi packages tagged as 'dev' can be shown here:

 *  [https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda/channel/dev](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda/channel/dev)

The default channel is the **main** channel.
If a file is tagged in the **main** channel then the channel name may be omitted from the URL.
For example the following repositories are equivalent:

 *  [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/conda/channel/main](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda/channel/main)
 *  [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/conda](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda)

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Private packages') %}

Packages may also be private. This means that you must explicitly have access to view the package.
To view and install private packages, you must identify yourself to anaconda.org.
This is done with [access tokens](examples.html#UsingAnacondaOrgTokens).
Once you have generated a token (`<TOKEN>`), you may prefix any repository url with `/t/<TOKEN>`

Note: this is just an example. You will not see any extra private packages in the conda **user namespace**.

 *  To install **private conda** packages from the conda user, use the repository
     url [https://**conda**.anaconda.org/t/&lt;TOKEN&gt;/conda](https://conda.anaconda.org/conda)
 *  To install **private pypi** packages from the conda user, use the repository
    url [https://**pypi**.anaconda.org/t/&lt;TOKEN&gt;/conda](https://pypi.anaconda.org/conda)

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Creating a new package') %}


All packages you author must be created in a user account. To create a package go to [anaconda.org/new](https://anaconda.org/new).

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Select the privacy access to your package') %}

You will be prompted with two options:

1. **Personal**: The new package will be hosted on your personal repository. This package will be viewable and installable by anonymous users.
   Users must add your unique repository url to their package manager's configuration.
1. **Private**: The new package will be hosted on your personal repository; however, you control the list of authorized users that will be able to access or modify this package.


{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Add a file to your package') %}

To upload files to anaconda.org it is recommended to use [anaconda-client](cli.html).

Run the command:

`anaconda upload FILE-NAME`


Your package can now be found on your profile page: `https://anaconda.org/<USERNAME>/<PACKAGE>`

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Remove a past version of one of your packages') %}

To remove a past version of one of your packages from anaconda.org:

1. Click the package name.

2. Click the tab "Files".

3. Click the checkbox to the left of the version you wish to remove.

4. Click the "Actions" menu and then "Remove".

You may instead use the [command line interface](cli.html):

`anaconda remove jsmith/testpack/0.2`

NOTE: Replace `jsmith`, `testpack`, and `0.2` with your actual user name, package name, and version.

The change can now be seen on your profile page: `https://anaconda.org/<USERNAME>/<PACKAGE>`

{% endcall %}
{% call subsection('Delete one of your packages') %}

To delete one of your packages from anaconda.org, including all of its versions:

1. Click the package name.

2. Click the tab "Settings".

3. Click "Admin" on the left side menu.

4. Click "Delete".

You may instead use the [command line interface](cli.html):

`anaconda remove jsmith/testpak`

NOTE: Replace `jsmith` and `testpak` with your actual user name and package name.

The change can now be seen on your profile page: `https://anaconda.org/<USERNAME>`
