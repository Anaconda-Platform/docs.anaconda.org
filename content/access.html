## Public Packages

### Namespaces

Packages on binstar are contained withing namespaces.
Each user has his or her own personal namespace called a **user namespace** where they may host packages.
You can view the packages in a users namespace by navigating to their user page.
For example, the [binstar](https://binstar.org/binstar) user namespace contains the binstar package.


Depending on the package manager you are using
<em>(The currently supported package types are [conda](conda.html) and [pypi](pypi.html))</em>
You will use the corisponding subdomain designed to work with that package manager:

 *  To install **conda** packages from the binstar user, use the repository
     url [https://**conda**.binstar.org/binstar](https://conda.binstar.org/binstar)
 *  To install **pypi** packages from the binstar user, use the repository
    url [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/binstar](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar)

### Channels

Furthermore each file within a package may be tagged in zero or more [channels](channels.html),
this allows package authors to upload files for development or testing purposes without
affecting non-development users.

If you navigate to  [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/binstar](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar) you will see a channel
dropdown listing all the available channels in this user namespace.

For example all of the pypi packages tagged as 'dev' can be shown here:

 *  [https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar/channel/dev](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar/channel/dev)

The default channel is the **main** channel.
If a file is tagged in the **main** channel then the channel name may be omitted from the url

For example the following repositories are equivalent:

 *  [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/binstar/channel/main](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar/channel/main)
 *  [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/binstar](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar)


## Private Packages

Packages may also be private. This means that you must explicitly have access to view the package.
To view and install private packages, you must identify yourself to binstar. 
This is done with [access tokens](token_gen.html)
Once you have generated a token (`<TOKEN>`), you may prefix any repository url with `/t/<TOKEN>`

Note this is just an example, you will not see any extra private packages in the binstar **user namespace**

 *  To install **private conda** packages from the binstar user, use the repository
     url [https://**conda**.binstar.org/t/&lt;TOKEN&gt;/binstar](https://conda.binstar.org/binstar)
 *  To install **private pypi** packages from the binstar user, use the repository
    url [https://**pypi**.binstar.org/t/&lt;TOKEN&gt;/binstar](https://pypi.binstar.org/binstar)
